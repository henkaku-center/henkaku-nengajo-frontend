## On collaborating

Henkaku is not a completely open community and, while this is an open source project, many communications about the project as well as the tokens to operate it are only shared among community members.

This site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and preview sites are automatically created for each new pull request. However, if the PR comes from a forked repo, the preview deployment will need to be approved by a maintainer. Please wait for us to notice the PR or talk to us over Discord.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
